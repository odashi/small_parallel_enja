small_parallel_enja: 50k En/Ja Parallel Corpus for Testing SMT Methods
======================================================================

This directory includes a small parallel corpus for English-Japanese
translation task. These data are extracted from
[TANAKA Corpus](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus)
by filtering sentence length 4 to 16 words.

English sentences are tokenized using
[Stanford Tokenizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.html)
and lowercased.
Japanese sentences are tokenized using [KyTea](http://www.phontron.com/kytea/).

All texts are encoded in UTF-8. Sentence separator is `'\n'` and word separator
is `' '`.

Attention: some English characters have different tokenization results from Stanford Tokenizer,
e.g., "don't" -> "don" "'t", which may come from preprocessing errors.
Please take care of using this dataset in token-level evaluation.
